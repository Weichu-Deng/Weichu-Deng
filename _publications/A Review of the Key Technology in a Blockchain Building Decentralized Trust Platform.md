Currently, the trust mechanisms of various Internet application platforms are still built
under the orders of centralized authorities. This centralized trust mechanism generally suffers from
problems such as excessive power of central nodes, single point of failure and data privacy leakage.
Blockchain is a new type of distributed data architecture with non-tamperability, openness and
transparency, and traceability, which can achieve secure and trustworthy sharing of data without
the participation of third-party authorities. The decentralized trust mechanism built based on the
blockchain provides a new research paradigm with broad development prospects to solve the problem
of establishing reliable information sharing under the environmental conditions of incomplete
reliability in finance, healthcare, energy, and data security. In response to the issues exposed by
centralized trust mechanisms in recent years, based on the critical technology of blockchain, this paper
surveys the relevant literature around the vital issue of building a decentralized and secure trust
mechanism. First, the decentralized trust mechanism architecture is sorted out by comparing different
decentralized platforms. The blockchain is divided into the data layer, network layer, consensus layer,
contract layer and application layer, which correspond to the theory, implementation, operation,
extension, and application of the decentralized trust mechanism of a blockchain, a district-centric
platform. Secondly, the principles and technologies of blockchain are elaborated in detail, focusing on
the underlying principles, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. Finally, blockchain problems
and development directions are summarized in light of relevant literature.
